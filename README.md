# A ChromeOS-style LightDM Webkit Greeter Theme

**Unmaintained. I no longer use LightDM. Feel free to fork.**

[Install it!](https://github.com/legostax/lightdm-webkit-chromium/wiki/Installation)

## Features

- Looks just like Chromium OS!
- Similar animations
- Login cards are dynamically created based on the user list
- Session entries are dynamically created based on the configured sessions
